## Challenges

<details>
<summary>Challenge 1: User Registration</summary>

- **Description:**
  Create a user registration system that allows new users to sign up. The system should validate user inputs, check for duplicate emails, and securely store user data.

- **Key Features:**

  - Input fields for username, email, and password.
  - Validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly.
  - Email format validation using regular expressions.
  - Password strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
  - Checking for existing users by email before registration.
  - Secure password hashing using libraries such as `bcrypt`.

- **Validation:**

  - Ensure the username is unique.
  - Validate the email format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
  - Ensure the password meets complexity requirements.

- **User Feedback:**
  - Provide success messages upon successful registration.
  - Display error messages for missing fields, invalid email formats, and existing email addresses.
- **Recommended Technologies:**
  - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development.
  - **Django REST Framework**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **Challenge Objective:**
  This challenge aims to assess the candidate's understanding of user authentication mechanisms, input validation, and secure data handling practices.

- **Tips:**
  - Utilize Django’s built-in forms for input validation.
  - Leverage Django signals to send welcome emails upon successful registration.
- **Final Considerations:**
  Ensure that the application is secure, with appropriate measures in place to protect user data. Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information, such as database credentials and secret keys.

<summary>Challenge 2: Task Management System</summary>

- **Description:**
  Build a simple task management system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The system should have an API that handles CRUD operations and ensures data integrity.

- **Key Features:**
  - An endpoint to create tasks, which includes a title and description.
  - An endpoint to retrieve all tasks or a specific task by ID.
  - An endpoint to update a task's title and/or description.
  - An endpoint to delete a task by ID.
- **Validation:**

  - Ensure that the title field is not empty when creating or updating tasks.
  - Validate that task IDs exist before attempting to update or delete them.

- **User Feedback:**

  - Provide messages indicating success or failure for each operation (e.g., task created, task not found).
  - Return the task details upon successful retrieval or update.

- **Recommended Technologies:**

  - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework.
  - **Django REST Framework**: For building RESTful APIs.

- **Challenge Objective:**
  This challenge evaluates the candidate's proficiency in building RESTful APIs, handling CRUD operations, and managing data relationships in Django.

- **Tips:**
  - Use Django’s model relationships (ForeignKey, ManyToManyField) to enhance task management features.
  - Implement pagination for the task list to improve performance with larger datasets.
- **Final Considerations:**
  Ensure the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices. Implement error handling to manage cases where tasks do not exist.

## Instructions for Candidates

- Each challenge is designed to be completed in approximately **1 hour**.
- Candidates are encouraged to work on these challenges in a live coding environment to allow for real-time assessment of their problem-solving skills.
- If time runs out before completion, do not worry; the goal is to showcase your skills rather than complete the task under pressure.

## Recommended Technologies

- **Django**: A robust web framework that simplifies backend development.
- **Django REST Framework**: Ideal for building APIs with Django.
- **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite**: For database management, depending on your familiarity and requirements.
- **Git**: For version control and code management.

## Final Considerations

Feel free to use these challenges as part of your hiring process. They are designed to help assess the technical skills of candidates in backend development, covering a range of essential topics and best practices. Good luck, and happy coding!
